# ProteinReducer
C++ program for creating a reduced representation of proteins

This program takes input from a protein structure file in the PDB file format. It outputs a reduced representation of the protein. This output can best be viewed with the Chimera protein viewer.

Compiles and runs easily using the GNU C++ compiler under either Linux or Windows. For example:

Windows:
mingw32-g++ main.cpp -o main.exe

Linux:
g++ main.cpp -o task2
